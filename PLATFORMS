Supported network platforms:

 'ios'          - Cisco IOS
                - You can load configuration using something like

                    copy http://<yourhost>/ios/<type> run

                  or

                    copy http://<yourhost>/ios/<type>/<name> run

 'junos'        - JunOS, load merge format
                - You can load configuration using something like

                    load merge http://<yourhost>/junos/<type> relative

                  or

                    load merge http://<yourhost>/junos/<type>/<name> relative

 'junosxsl'     - JunOS, operation script in XSLT format
                - You can load it and run it as an operational script:

                   1) Add operation script to your JunOS configuration

                       system {
                           scripts {
                               op {
                                   file bgp-policy.xsl {
                                       command bgp-policy;
                                       source http://<yourhost>/junosxsl/policy/<comma-separated-list-of-your-policies>;
                                   }
                               }
                           }
                       }

                   2) do "set system scripts op file bgp-policy.xsl refresh"
                      from edit mode (assuming you are at the top) manually
                      the first time to initially fetch the script.

                   3) from cli mode invoke "op bgp-policy commit" to apply
                      current BGP policy configuration from the script

                   4) whenever you want to update the script with latest BGP
                      policy, from cli mode invoke "op bgp-policy refresh" to
                      fetch fresh contents. Then you can apply new config by
                      issuing "op bgp-policy commit".

                   5) You'll probably want to automate this by generating
                      periodic events and triggering "bgp-policy refresh"
                      followed by "bgp-policy commit" at specific times.
