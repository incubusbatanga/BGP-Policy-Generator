Supported network platforms:

 'ios'          - Cisco IOS
                - You can load configuration using something like

                    copy http://<yourhost>/ios/<type> run

                  or

                    copy http://<yourhost>/ios/<type>/<name> run

 'junos'        - JunOS, load merge format
                - You can load configuration using something like

                    load merge http://<yourhost>/junos/<type> relative

                  or

                    load merge http://<yourhost>/junos/<type>/<name> relative

 'junosxsl'     - JunOS, operation script in XSLT format
                - You can load it and run it as an operation script:

                   a) Add operation script to your JunOS configuration

                       system {
                           scripts {
                               op {
                                   file bgp-policy.xsl {
                                       command bgp-policy;
                                       source http://<yourhost>/junosxsl/policy/<comma-separated-list-of-your-policies>;
                                   }
                               }
                           }
                       }

                      You have to refresh it manually to get the latest policy

                   b) Invoke it manually from cli mode as a remote script:

                        op url http://<yourhost>/junosxsl/policy/<comma-separated-list-of-your-policies>

                   c) Schedule it periodically. For example - 4 times a day:

                      event-options {
                          generate-event {
                            AT-0000 time-of-day "00:00:00";
                            AT-0600 time-of-day "06:00:00";
                            AT-1200 time-of-day "12:00:00";
                            AT-1800 time-of-day "18:00:00";
                          }
                          policy UPDATE-BGP-POLICY {
                              events [ AT-0000 AT-0600 AT-1200 AT-1800 ];
                              then {
                                  execute-commands {
                                      commands "op url http://<yourhost>/junosxsl/policy/<comma-separated-list-of-your-policies>";
                                  }
                              }
                          }
                      }
