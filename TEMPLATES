Templates are policy configuration layouts expressed in generic XML to separate
policy semantics from device-specific syntax. You can define your policy once
and produce any device-specific version of it whenever required. That way you
can migrate between different vendors without actually changing the logic
underneath. Also, some policies may have to be applied to more than one device
at a time, possibly from different vendors. Defining your policies as templates
saves you from defining different syntax versions of the same thing.

To make things simpler, templates use different tags and attributes as little
as possible. Not all tags or attributes are applicable in all scenarios. Although
general structure of policies is similar between different platforms, some things
are vendor-specific, or simply defined in different places. To keep templates as
universal as possible, device-specific configuration generators ignore unsupported
features present in templates.

Policy template
===============

This is what a single policy template file looks like:

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<policies>
    <policy id="POLICY_NAME">
        <term action="permit|deny" id="NAME_OF_THIS_POLICY_TERM">
            <match>
                <family>inet|inet6</family>
                <protocol id="ROUTING_PROCESS_ID">PROTOCOL_NAME</protocol>
                <prefix-list match="exact|longer|orlonger" include="yes|no">PREFIX_LIST_NAME</prefix-list>
                <as-path id="AS_PATH_ACCESS_LIST_NAME_OR_NUMBER">AS-PATH-REGEX</as-path>
                <neighbor id="NAME_OF_ACL_MATCHING_THIS_NEIGHBOR">NEIGHBOR_ADDRESS</neighbor>
                <community>COMMUNITY_LIST_NAME</community>
            </match>
            <set>
                <prepend>AS_PATH_PREPEND_STRING</prepend>
                <local-preference action="set|add|subtract">LOCAL_PREFERENCE_AMOUNT</local-preference>
                <protocol-preference action="set|add|subtract">PREFERENCE_AMOUNT</protocol-preference>
                <community action="set|add|delete" id="yunet-communities">COMMUNITY</community>
                <next-hop>self|reject|discard|peer-address|NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS</next-hop>
                <origin>igp|egp|incomplete</origin>
                <weight>WEIGHT_AMOUNT</weight>
                <med>METRIC_AMOUNT</med>
            </set>
        </term>
        <term ...>
           ...
        </term>
    </policy>
</policies>

Tag <policy> begins the policy definition. It contains one or more policy elements
specified within <term> tags. Takes 1 mandatory attribute:

 id - Unique policy identifier. In most cases, device-specific generators use this
      attribute as policy name.

Tag <term> defines a policy element that contains a set of match-set clauses bound
together by logical AND, while the <term> tags themselves are bound together by
logical OR. The order in which <term> tags are specified is the order in which prefixes
are matched against them. In other words, if all match clauses evaluate to TRUE, then
the term itself evaluates to TRUE and all the term's set clauses and the specified
action are applied to matching prefixes. If term evaluates to FALSE, then the next
term is processed. For example, <term> directly maps to JunOS's policy-statement term
and IOS's route-map <seq> <permit|deny> statement.

Tag <term> takes 2 mandatory attributes:

 id     - Unique term identifier within a single policy. It most commonly maps
          to the name of a policy element, depending on the target platform.
          On the other hand, some platforms, like IOS, don't use this attribute
          at all.

 action - Defines what happens with routes that match the term. If set to 'permit',
          routes are accepted. If set to 'deny', routes are discarded.

Tags <match> and <set> contain lists of match conditions and route transformation
operations respectively. Neither takes any attributes and the order in which they
are specified within a <term> is not significant. While processing a policy element,
match conditions specified within <match> tag are always processed first and only
if the entire <match> evaulates to TRUE and parent term's action is 'permit', set
operations specified within <set> tag are applied.

Match conditions are defined by the following tags:

 <prefix-list>  - Matches the route itself.
                - This is the most important match condition.
                - Tag's value specifies prefix list's name.
                - Prefix lists themselves can also be defined via templates
                  or be configured elsewhere and referenced here by name.
                - Takes 1 mandatory attribute:

                     'match' - the type of matching performed on routes:
                               'exact'    matches routes exactly as specified
                                          by prefix list definition,
                               'longer'   matches routes more specific than
                                          prefixes specified by prefix list,
                               'orlonger' matches routes exact and more specific
                                          than prefixes specified by prefix list.

                - Takes 1 optional attribute:

                     'include' - Determines whether prefix list definition should
                                 be included in output when generating policy
                                 configuration. Can be 'yes' or 'no'. If set to
                                 'no', only the policy itself is generated. If set
                                 to 'yes', prefix lists are generated along with
                                 the policy. Default is 'no'.

 <family>       - Matches the address family of a route.
                - Tag's value can be 'inet' or 'inet6'.
                - Doesn't take any attributes.

 <protocol>     - Matches the source protocol of a route.
                - Value can be one of the following:

                     connected (direct)
                     static
                     local
                     aggregate
                     rip
                     ripng
                     bgp
                     ospf (ospf2)
                     ospf3
                     eigrp
                     isis

                - Takes 1 mandatory attribute:

                     'id' - Router process ID. Not used on all platforms.

 <as-path>      - Matches the as-path of a route.
                - Tag's value specifies as-path regular expression name
                  used on some platforms while others use numeric ACL IDs.
                - Takes 1 mandatory attribute:

                     'id' - Unique identifier of the as-path access list
                            when used on platforms that use numeric ACL
                            IDs instead of as-path regular expression
                            names.

 <community>    - Matches a set of communities routes are tagged with.
                - Tag's value specifies the name of a community list.
                - Community lists themselves are defined elsewhere and their
                  format is beyond the scope of this document.
                - Takes no attributes.

 <neighbor>     - Matches the source of a route.
                - Tag's value specifies the address of a BGP peer, used on 
                  some platforms, while others refer to neighbors via ACLs.
                - Takes 1 mandatory attribute:

                     'id' - Unique identifier of the access list matching
                            BGP peer's address when used on platforms that
                            use ACLs instead of directly specifying peer's
                            address in policy definition.


Route property transformation operations are defined by the following tags:

 <prepend>              - Prepends one or more ASNs to route's as-path.
                        - Tag's value specifies the prepend string.
                        - Takes no attributes.

 <protocol-preference>  - Sets route's protocol preference (administrative
                          distance). Not applicable on all platforms.
                        - Tag's value specifies the protocol preference value,
                          either absolute or relative.
                        - Takes 1 optional attribute:

                           'action' - Operator performed on route's protocol
                                      preference:
                                      'set'      sets route's protocol preference
                                                 to the specified value,

                            'egp'         - set route's origin to EGP
                            'incomplete'  - set route's origin to incomplete

                          Not all values are supported on all platforms.

Prefix list template
====================

This is what a single prefix list template file looks like:

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?> 
<prefix-lists>
    <prefix-list id="PREFIX_LIST_NAME" family="inet|inet6" origin="PREFIX_LIST_ORIGIN_ASN">
        <item upto="MAX_PREFIX_LEN">PREFIX1</item>
        <item upto="MAX_PREFIX_LEN">PREFIX2</item>
        <item upto="MAX_PREFIX_LEN">PREFIX3</item>
    </prefix-list>
</prefix-lists>

This is self-explanatory (more or less).

Tag <prefix-list>  begins prefix list definition. It takes 2 mandatory attributes:

 'id'      - the unique prefix list identifier, in most cases - the name
 'family'  - address family of prefixes within prefix list. Can be 'inet' for
             IPv4 prefixes or 'inet6' for IPv6 prefixes.

Takes 1 optional attribute:

 'origin'  - ASN that originated prefixes within prefix list. Only informational.

Tag <item> defines each member prefix. Tag's value contains the IPv4 or IPv6 prefix,
depending on the address family of the prefix list. Takes one optional attribute:

 'upto'   - Maximum prefix length of routes matching this prefix. Not applicable
            on all platforms. For example, JunOS prefix lists do not specify max
            prefix length. In contrast, IOS prefix lists specify max prefix length
            for each member prefix. Therefore, generators for some platforms, like
            Cisco IOS, will use 'upto' to generate prefix lists that match both
            exact prefixes and their more specific children up to the 'upto' prefix
            length. Others, like JunOS generator, will ignore this attribute and
            specify prefix length limits within policy.

Free-form device-specific configuration
=======================================

In case templates are not flexibile enough for your needs, both policy and prefix list
templates support <config> tag that allows you to specify device-specific configuration
by hand. This tag can be used in various places within templates:

<policies>
    <policy>
        <config platform="..." action="prepend">
        <term>
            <config platform="..." action="prepend">
            <match>
                <config platform="..." action="prepend">
                ...
                <config platform="..." action="append">
            </match>
            <set>
                <config platform="..." action="prepend">
                ...
                <config platform="..." action="append">
            </set>
            <config platform="..." action="append">
        </term>
        <config platform="..." action="append">
    </policy>
</policies>


<prefix-lists>
    <prefix-list>
        <config platform="..." action="prepend">
        ...
        <config platform="..." action="append">
    </prefix-list>
</prefix-lists>

Both 'platform' and 'action' attributes are mandatory:

 'platform'  - Target platform for this free-form configuration. Only tags matching
               the platform whose configuration is being generated will be used.
               Others are ignored. That way you can insert free-form configuration
               for multiple platforms.

 'action'    - Where to put contents of this tag:

                 'prepend'   - Insert before other content within current hierarchy
                 'append'    - Add after other content within current hierarchy

The value of a <config> tag can be any text of any size. Bear in mind, though, that
if you want to insert XML, HTML or anything that uses XML-like tags, you need to embed
it inside <![CDATA[  ... ]]> tag.

Auto-policy template
====================

It is basically the same as policy template and most of it is copied as is when
generating policy templates from it. However, there are a few differences:

Tag <policy> uses 2 mandatory attributes:

 'peer-as' - ASN of the BGP neighbor this policy is applied to. It is used to fetch
             prefixes specified AS announces to AS defined as 'local_as' in config.php.

 'family'  - Used to determine the address family of generated prefix lists. It can
             either be 'inet' for IPv4 prefixes, or 'inet6' for IPv6.

Tag <auto-prefix-list> within <match> takes the same attributes as <prefix-list>
with a few differences - additional attributes 'origin', 'aggregate', 'upto' and
'filter'. Also, the value of this tag is not mandatory and not a prefix list name,
but an optional string to prepend to the generated prefix list name.

        <auto-prefix-list match="exact|longer|orlonger" include="yes|no"
         origin="ASN_REGEX" aggregate="yes|no" upto="MAXIMUM_PREFIX_LENGTH"
         filter="PREFIX_REGEX">NAME_PREPEND_STRING</auto-prefix-list>

 'origin'    - Selects prefixes by their origin. Prefixes whose origin ASNs match
               this regex will be used to generate prefix lists and their respective
               <prefix-list> tags in place of <auto-prefix-list>. This means that not
               only does this regex picks which prefix lists will be generated, but
               also defines the exact spot inside generated policy template these
               prefix lists will be referenced from.
 'aggregate' - Indicates whether collected prefixes should be aggregated into largest
               possible blocks prior to generating prefix lists. Works only on IPv4
               at the moment. Can be 'yes' or 'no'.

 'upto'      - Defines maximum prefix length for prefixes going into generated prefix
               list templates. Prefixes longer than 'upto' value are ignored and won't
               appear in the generated prefix list templates. For prefixes that do make
               it into generated prefix list templates, 'upto' is copied to the 'upto'
               attribute of prefix list item tags.

 'filter'    - A regular expression used to select prefixes. When generating policies
               using autopolicy template, this attribute is used to specify which
               prefix lists and matching <prefix-list> tags should be generated.

Since there are several criteria that determine the fate of a prefix, it is important
to understand how they relate to each other:

                      origin => aggregate => upto => filter

First, origin regex selects prefixes by origin. Since prefix-lists group prefixes
by origin, this effectively determines which prefix lists will be generated.

Once prefixes (and thus prefix lists) are selected, per-prefix-list aggregation is
performed if aggregate="yes" is configured. Prefix lists will contain only the
largest possible address blocks.

Aggregated prefixes are then filtered with 'upto' attribute which weeds out prefixes
which are more specific than 'upto' value. This may seem reduntant since aggregation
does similar thing. However, aggregation concatenates adjacent address blocks into
larger blocks, making prefix lists smaller without loosing any information, while
'upto' attribute drops any prefix that is longer than specified, whether a part of
information is lost or not. In other words, aggregation is given a chance to gracefully
solve the problem of long prefixes before the 'upto' hacksaw removes anything that
sticks out. Also, many prefixes simply cannot be aggregated - 'upto' will drop longer
prefixes indiscriminately. Finally, 'upto' is used in <item> tags of generated
prefix list templates. It's use there depends on the target platform.

At last, prefixes that survived previous filtering will be matched against value of
'filter' attribute, if it is defined. It is a regular expression that matches
prefixes directly, so you can do (almost) whatever you want here.

So, this tag's effect is two-fold:

 1) it is used to generate prefix-list templates
 2) it is used as a template for actual prefix-list tags that will take it's place
    in generated policy template.

Using regular expressions to select prefixes by several criteria makes it possible to
divide generated prefixes between terms, should some of them be treated differently
than others.
