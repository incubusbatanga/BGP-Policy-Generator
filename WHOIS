Whois is configured using following parameters:

  $config['whois_server']            - Hostname or IPv4/IPv6 address of the server.

                                       Default: whois.ripe.net.

  $config['whois_port']              - TCP port of the whois service

                                       Default: 43

  $config['whois_address_family']    - Address family or families used for connection.
                                       If whois server is specified as an IP address,
                                       the address must match address family (obviously).
                                       If hostname is given, it may resolve to both
                                       IPv4 and IPv6 address(es). This parameter will
                                       determine which one will be tried first or used
                                       exclusively.
                                       Can be:

                                         - AF_INET for IPv4 connection
                                         - AF_INET6 for IPv6 connection
                                         - array(AF_INET, AF_INET6) to allow both
                                           IPv4 and IPv6 connection, preferring
                                           IPv4 over IPv6.
                                         - array(AF_INET6, AF_INET) to allow both
                                           IPv4 and IPv6 connection, preferring
                                           IPv6 over IPv4.

                                       Default: array(AF_INET6, AF_INET)

  $config['whois_type']              - RIPE-compatibile whois flavor. This option is
                                       used to determine the way bulk mode is handled.
                                       Can be:

                                         - 'ripe' for native RIPE server
                                         - 'irrd' for IRRd-based server
                                         - NULL for generic whois server, which disables
                                           bulk mode. Compatibility versus performance.
                                           Still needs to support RIPE-compatibile
                                           options, tho.

                                       Default: 'ripe'

  $config['whois_source']            - RPSL database source. When using RIPE's native
                                       server, there is no source other than 'RIPE',
                                       but IRRd based servers hosting or mirroring more
                                       than one database could have multiple objects
                                       with same primary/lookup keys, but different
                                       source. Therefore it is important to explicitly
                                       specify which source database to use.

                                       Default: 'ripe'

  $config['whois_sock_timeout']      - Timeout (in seconds) for socket operations (like
                                       connect, for example).

                                       Default: 5

  $config['whois_query_timeout']     - Maximum time in seconds a single query can last.
                                       With bulk queries, it's a single query for multiple
                                       objects and therefore a single timeout interval.
                                       When bulk mode is disabled, one query is issued
                                       per object, each having it's own timeout interval.

                                       Default: 300
